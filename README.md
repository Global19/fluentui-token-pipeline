# FluentUI token pipeline

The FluentUI token pipeline produces source code for the FluentUI libraries. **It is currently a proof-of-concept.**

## Configuring the pipeline

You can configure the location where the pipeline produces output filesâ€”see the bottom of `config.js`. For more information about `config.js`, see the [style-dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/) documentation: the FluentUI token pipeline uses `style-dictionary` for its configuration.

## Building the pipeline

To build the pipeline and produce the output files, just run `npm run build`. That's it!
